# Kantan 簡単 (simple, easy) - A set of bash scripts to launch a web server, watch files and launch build commands.
#
# Please take the time to configure the script
#
# The text printed each time you save (probably don't touch this):
FILENAME=$(echo -e "\033[1;33m%w%f\033[0m written")
# The key combination to refresh your browser:
KEY="CTRL+F5" 
 # The browser you use (currently only firefox is supported):
BROWSER="firefox" 
 # The folder or file you want to watch:
LOCATION="./data/content/"
# The server type you want to use (use the ones provided or create your own):
SERVER_TYPE="node" 
# The folder you want to serve with the server
DIST="./www"
# The build command you want to use (ex: npm run dev) or leave empty if you just want to refresh the page:
BUILD="node src/builder.mjs & src/images.sh"
