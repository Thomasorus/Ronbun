<p>Bought in 2016 at Akihabara in Japan, this HHKB had been my daily driver since. It took several weeks to get used to it as I learned both to write in QWERTY and the very special layout of this keyboard. It's currently customised with a <a href="https://kbdfans.com/products/pre-orderelectrostatic-capacity-keyboard-japanese-keycaps?<em>pos=16&</em>sid=098521c43&_ss=r">japanese keyset</a>. As for all HHKBs, the switches are Topre.</p><h2 id="hhkb-plate-replica" style="position:relative;"><a href="#hhkb-plate-replica" aria-label="HHKB plate replica permalink" style="display:inline-block;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;"></a>HHKB plate replica</h2><img loading="lazy" src="media/hhkb-plate.jpg" alt="My plate replica of HHKB">

<p>Bought in 2018 to have a second keyboard with the HHKB layout to drop at work. This keyboard initially had a rough CNC cut plate with Outemu Purple switches. I unsoldered the switchs and replaced them with Cherry MX Silent Red. A friend also lubbed them to avoid making noise. A vinyl like sticker was then applied to the plate to hide the rough metal.</p>
