His mother died giving him birth, making his father resent him. He grew in solitude and was given a strict education that left him without space to breathe.</p><p>At the (link: empty-and-full/age-of-trial text: Age of Trial), he was sent to war, like all others of his kind. As the only heir of his family, he should been given a secure position during his two cycle service. Unfortunately, his father opponents maneuvered to place him in the battlefield, hoping for its death and the possibility to inherit his family's Flower House.</p><p>During his two cycles service, The First One managed to survive all the battles he was sent to. He made a lot of companions among the Brambles Folks, broadened his horizons and developed a profound anti-war and anarchist attitude. Unfortunately, he was injured during his last battle at the end of his two cycles service. He lost his two arms and was heavily disfigured. Not capable of fighting, he was sent home where he discovered died not long ago.</p><p>Not willing to have children and incapable of handling most political and administrative tasks he inherited with the Flower House, he called his ancient war companions for help. As law forbids to inherit a Flower House when its owner is still alive, The First One organized its own as an anarchist organization and drafted a testament where he gave away everything he had to its group.</p><p>After a few years later, once all the talks about his political choices disminished, he announced to his closest companions his will to free all the slaves living on his Flower House. By doing so, he hoped it would encourage a more global slave revolution on the other Flower Houses. He also said his Flower House should be open to anyone and that it's wealth should be shared with the Brambles Folk.</p><h2>Boxes Filling Space</h2></body></html>
