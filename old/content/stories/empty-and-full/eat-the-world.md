# Eat The World

**Eat the World** is the first arc of **Empty and Full**. It tells the story of several beings led by The First One, a creature betrayed by its kind seeking revenge. As he refused to be taken to eternal rest by its own God so he could take revenge, he concluded a pact with The Brambles and became an enslaved immortal.

As both the vessel and slave of The Brambles, he then proceeded to recruit other outcasts and shared his powers with them. Together they started a general war with the goal of destroying void itself by filling it with The Brambles.
