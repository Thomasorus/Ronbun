# Empty and Full

**Empty and Full** is a saga narrating the story of [The First One](#the-first-one), an immortal being who tries to restore balance in an universe he subverted. The whole saga is divided into three major stories: Eat The World, Boxes Filling Space and a third unknown story.

**Empty and Full** is used a playground to experiment storytelling and painting, but also to question personal philosophical interrogations.
