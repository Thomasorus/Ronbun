# Flower Hunters

FLower hunters are a cast of specialized biologists trained to art of survival in the brambles. Most of the time they are hired for many years by privilegied individuals looking for new flower houses. Flower Hunters travel endlessly and alone through the brambles. When they find a potential flower house, they note its location by going at the top of the brambles and looking at the starts. Then they rate the flower chance of survival and if it can't survive or  grow big enough to form a new house, they are harvested or left alone.

The hunters are easily identified by their full black clothing, their strange mask or their darkened skin color. Hunters are also a rarety. They require several years of education before being able to explore the brambles and a lot of them die in their first years. Despite what most people think, they are not a cult and don't worship any specific god.

Flower hunters all share the basic same equipment:
- Shears, saws and blades to cut brambles and going forward
- Full black clothes to avoid being detected
- Maps, localisation and direction tools compass, maps and sextans.
- Hunting tools : bow and arrows, traps
- A portable greenhouse where they repot small flower they harvested

The rate of flower discovery has been increasing as hunters became more efficient in their survival craft. But not the rate of habitable flowers remain near zero. The last discovered flower house was 317 units ago.
