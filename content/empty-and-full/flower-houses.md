# Flower Houses

Flower Houses are gigantic habitable flowers. They mostly belong to wealthy families, who use the light and warmth to grow food and medicinal plants. As it's almost impossible to grow anything into the Brambles, Flower Houses provide a massive amount of the global food consumed.

Products from the flowers themselves or their leaves are also used to create luxurious goods, rare medicine and elaborate clothing. Most Flower Houses rely on enslaved Bramble Folks for their workforce, promising them a better life, sunlight, absence of war.
