# Pierre Soulages

Pierre Soulages is an artist born in 1919 and known as the **master of black**. As a seeker of shapes, he took inspiration in threes during sunset, broken windows fixed with tar and abstract geometries.

He is most known for the Outrenoir, a series of complete black paintings where he sculpted the surface. Despite being completely dark, Outrenoirs are constantly changing due to how light reflects on them.
